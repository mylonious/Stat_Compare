#Stat_Compare

I used this script to compare formulas for stat growth in a personal game project.

I plan to come back to this project in the future to broaden it and polish it as my game moves further but for now it give's me csv's containing the base that i can test in engine.

as is the current version of the program is very rough and may behave oddly due to removing some of my personal project name's etc. 

#COMMANDS

mak/sim : auto = testing function - 
creates list of creatures and graph comparing stat growth.

cre : create npc - assign stat affinty / element.

set : change xp per level / spread settings 

csv : create .csv of creatures to level (in settings)
